# Abstract

Decision Tree is an algorithm, which belongs to the group of Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Decision Trees are inverted trees with a root node, internal nodes and leaf nodes. Mainly two types of Decision Trees are used widely - CART and ID3. But, the root nodes are decided depending on an impurity index. CART uses Gini Index and ID3 uses Entropy as impurity indices and also to decide the dividing attribute at each node. In this work, both CART and ID3 are applied on the Titanic Dataset, without specfying any other parameters. Then a suitable tree is found by applying Grid Search method and the resulting tree is also found to be an ID3 tree. ID3 tree from Grid Search gives importance to all the features, but the previous ID3 tree does not consider "Sex" as an important feature - which is not acceptable at all, as it is clear from the Exploratoy Data Analysis part that, **"Sex" played an important role in survival of a passenger**. Now, both CART and ID3 from Grid Search gives importance to all the features, but the accuracy on the testing set is higher in case of the CART. But it seems that, CART overfits as it is giving approximately 0.91 accuracy score on the training set. So, the ID3 obtained from the Grid Search wil be better to use.
