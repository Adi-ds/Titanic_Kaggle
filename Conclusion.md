After the EDA and the visualizations, we can conclude the following (considering the training set mainly) :
1. There were **63 families aboard**. Considering the members of the families, *142 passengers were travelling with families* (including the testing set).
2. **537 passengers (approximately 79% of the passenger population) were travelling alone** (including the testing set).
3. Survival Ratio is greater for the passenger population who were travelling with family. In other words, most of the passengers, who were travelling alone, did not survive that night.
4. Out of the total passenger population, **577 (64.76%) were male passengers** and **314 (35.24%) were female passegers**.
5. **342 (only 38.38%) passengers survived**. In other words, **549 (61.62%) passengers did'nt survive that night**.
6. Among the survived population 68.13% were female passengers. So, **Sex played a vital role in the survival of a passenger**.
7. Maximum number of passengers were in the age group of 19-35 years.
8. Most of the children survived and also, the eldest person on Titanic were saved. So, **Age played a vital role in survival of a passenger**.
9. **419 (55.11%) passengers** were travelling in **3rd Class**, which is maximum. **184 (20.65%) passengers** were travelling in **2nd Class**, which is minimum.
10. **Sex Ratio was maximum in 3rd Class**. In other words, *maximum male passengers in 3rd Class were travelling alone*.
11. Out of 38.38% survived population, *39.77% passengers were from 1st Class, which is maximum*. So, **Many passengers got their life back for their money and status**.
12. Among the survived-female passengers, most of them were from 1st Class.
13. Among the died-male passengers, most of them were from 3rd Class.
14. The survival ratio is 1 in case of the female passengers of 3rd Class.
15. 72.50% of the passenger population boarded Titanic from Southampton.
16. Sex ratio is also highest among the passegers, who boarded from Southampton.
